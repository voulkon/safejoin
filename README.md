# safejoin

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R build status](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/safejoin/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/safejoin/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of safejoin is to guarantee that when performing joins that extra rows are not added to your data. safejoin is a wrapper around the [`dplyr::left_join`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html) function.

- [Docs](https://safejoin-r.netlify.app/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/safejoin/)
- CRAN (not yet published)

## Installation

safejoin is currently under development. An update will be published here once the package is published on CRAN.

<!--
You can install the released version of safejoin from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("safejoin")
```
-->

## Example

Depending on your need safejoin can raise an error, a warning, or a message. By default safejoin will raise an error.

**Error**:


```r
library(safejoin)
x <- data.frame(key = c("a", "b"), value_x = c(1, 2))
y <- data.frame(key = c("a", "a"), value_y = c(1, 1))
safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key")
#> Error in safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key"): Input data x had 2 rows. After performing the join the data has 3 rows.
```

**Warning**:


```r
safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key", action="warning")
#> Warning in safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key", action = "warning"): Input data x had 2 rows. After
#> performing the join the data has 3 rows.
#>   key value_x value_y
#> 1   a       1       1
#> 2   a       1       1
#> 3   b       2      NA
```

**Message**:


```r
safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key", action="message")
#> Input data x had 2 rows. After performing the join the data has 3 rows.
#>   key value_x value_y
#> 1   a       1       1
#> 2   a       1       1
#> 3   b       2      NA
```

When a join is "safe" `safe_left_join` will have the exact same behavior as [`dplyr::left_join`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html).


```r
x <- data.frame(key = c("a", "b"), value_x = c(1, 2))
y <- data.frame(key = c("a", "b"), value_y = c(1, 1))
safe_left_join(x, y, by = "key")
#>   key value_x value_y
#> 1   a       1       1
#> 2   b       2       1
```
